# Capstone Proposal

### Name of Student:Remy Flores

### Name of Project: Cringe Social (I'm horrible with name, it's a work-in-progress)

### Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?) 
I have a fondness for the nostalgia of MySpace and Tumblr, and I'm interested in creating a platform that combines<br>
the elements of a blog and a social space. However, I envision it with a more visually appealing user interface.<br>
<br>
One key feature I'd like to implement is the ability to post pictures and share them beyond the confines of a login-based<br> 
system. Additionally, I'm considering incorporating APIs for music and video to enhance the overall user experience.<br>
<br>
By blending the aesthetics and social aspects of MySpace and Tumblr, while leveraging modern UI design principles, I <br>
believe we can create a unique platform that captures the essence of the past while offering an enhanced and more visually 
pleasing user experience.<br>
<br>

### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
*	User registration (database storage)

*	User login/logout (database authentication)

*	Ablitiy to post a picture

* Make a status update

### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* For the framework, we should definitely go with NEXT.js as it offers a powerful and efficient development environment for building modern web applications. Its server-side rendering capabilities and seamless integration with React make it an excellent choice.

* To ensure type safety and improved developer productivity, we'll use TypeScript as the programming language. TypeScript provides static typing and enhanced tooling, enabling us to catch errors early and write more robust code.

* For the database, I propose using PostgreSQL, a reliable and feature-rich open-source database management system. To handle data storage and management efficiently, we can leverage Supabase, a flexible and scalable cloud-based platform. With Supabase, we can easily interact with the PostgreSQL database, handle user authentication, and manage data storage and retrieval.

* To simplify database operations and improve productivity, we'll employ Prisma as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool. Prisma offers a convenient and intuitive way to interact with the database through a type-safe API, allowing us to define and manipulate data models with ease.By combining the power of NEXT.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL with Supabase, and Prisma as the ORM, we can build a robust, scalable, and efficient web application with a seamless development experience and excellent data management capabilities.

### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
* Integrate music seamlessly: Users can enjoy a curated music experience while navigating the platform, creating a harmonious blend of content and sound.

* Monetization opportunities: Implementing strategically placed advertisements will help generate revenue to support the platform's operations and ensure its sustainability.

* Influencer recognition: Introduce a prestigious "blue check mark" status for users who have attained significant "hype" through their contributions and engagement, giving them elevated recognition and influence.

* Like system for hype: Encourage user interaction and engagement through a robust "like" system, where each like contributes to a user's hype score, fostering a vibrant and supportive community.

* Robust security measures: Implement advanced security protocols to protect user accounts and sensitive information, ensuring a safe and trustworthy environment for all users.

* Exploring the world of NFTs: Embrace the innovative concept of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to empower users in unique and creative ways, opening doors for artistic expression, collaboration, and digital ownership.

* Presentation readiness: Prepare a well-structured and engaging presentation to effectively showcase the platform's features, benefits, and potential, avoiding any unintended language slip-ups and ensuring a professional and polished delivery.

### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
* Google Sign-in

*	Spotify API

*	Web hosting (not sure on specifics)

### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
I'm starting to understand how costly some of the backend can be. Nextjs has it benefits and I have a lot to learn.
